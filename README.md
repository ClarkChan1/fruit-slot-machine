## Design Decisions

1. To make it realistic I created a lose condition when coins goes to 0 or below. If the user loses, they will be prompted to play again. Tokens will be reset to 100 when user clicks play again.
2. I decided not to make a win condition, because in real casinos you can play as much as you want as long as you have money.
3. If the user matches 2 fruits, those slots are highlighted green.
4. If the user matches 3 fruits, all the slots do a little rainbow animation.
